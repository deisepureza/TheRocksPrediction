# TheRocksPrediction

Technologies:  Scikit Learning (Machine Learning model) Data Preprocessing using dataset Visualization of Dataset Feature Scaling, Model development Implementation of sequential, LSTM Neural Network, Recural Neural Network (RNN)

# Problem Statement 
Currently, the markets movement is predicted by the investors by analyzing the stock prices and stock indicators while closely following the news about the stocks, as of now, the release of the stock market news is categorized as either Positive or Negative. This is used to show their effect on the stock price, this app will be used to predict the future movement of the stock market.

# Our take
Our purpose is to build and application using Machine Learning, mathematical functions, Recural Neural Networks (RNN). Therefore, some other factors such as previous datasets and the stock news to create an application with more accurate stock prediction. On Successful creation of this application, we will be able to use this to create profitable trades in future.

# Stock Price Prediction
This Project aims to provide an investor with a third-party web application to navigate stock prediction prices. This Project will be done by using Machine Learning and Web Technologies, making it possible to access by multi-platform devices. In this project, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network which is widely used for sequence predictions problems once LSTM is able to store past information that is important and discard the information that is not relevant. Hence, will present data using Data visualizations Plots dash for stock analysis.
To develop the dashboard for stock prediction we will use a stock dataset of different companies and indexes, such as APPLE, MICROSOFT, METAVERSE, COCA-COLA, UNILEVER.

We understand that stock market analysis involves analyzing the companyâ€™s future profitability on the basis of the business financial performance and making use of the technical analysis that includes, reading charts and using statical figures to identify and predict the trends in the stock market, which will be our focus during this project by using a dataset. In order to predict the daily closing price of the stock, we aim to use practices such as moving average in our dataset to making predictions, for example, the previous closing price for each day will be the average of a set of previously observed values
